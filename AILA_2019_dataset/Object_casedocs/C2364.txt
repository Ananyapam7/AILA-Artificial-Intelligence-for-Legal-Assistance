State of Rajasthan v Jeet Singh
Supreme Court of India

3 February 1983
Cr.A. No. 569 of 1976
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal by the State the High Court altered the conviction of the respondent Jeet Singh from S. 302 and 307 IPC read with S. 34 IPC to S. 323 IPC.
2.  We see no reason to differ with the view taken by the High Court as it is clear from the evidence on record that Jeet Singh did not share the common intention to cause the death with the main accused. There is no merit in the appeal which is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
