Shakeel Ahmed v State, Delhi
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 493/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant stands convicted under Section 326 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Injuries, no doubt, are grievous as the phalanx of the index finger has been snipped off. But the allegation is that the assailant had bitten the index finger and caused the said injury. Teeth of human being cannot be considered as deadly weapon as per the description of deadly weapon enumerated under Section 326 of the IPC.
Hence the offence cannot escalate to Section 326. It can best remain only at Section 325 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. We, therefore, alter the conviction to Section 325 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
2.  The said change of the count of offence warrants change of the quantum of sentence also. In the interest of justice we deem it necessary to impose a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 6 months besides a fine of Rs.10,000/-. The sentence is accordingly modified.
3.  If he defaults in payment of fine he shall undergo imprisonment for a further period of three months. In case the fine amount is realised the victim shall be paid a sum of Rs. 8000/- out of the said fine amount. The trial court shall see that the said amount is paid to the injured in case the fine amount is realised from the appellant. The appellant shall surrender to his bail. However, we may add that if the jail authorities shall determine whether any further period remains to be undergone by him to complete the sentence imposed now on him.The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
