Jago Yadav and Others v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2003
Cr.A. No. 567 Of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The seven appellants before us and one other accused person Lila Yadav were charged for the offence punishable under Sections 302 read with 149, 147, 324 and 323 IPC before the 4th Additional Sessions Judge, Gaya. After trial he found the appellants and said Lila Yadav guilty of the offences punishable under Section 302 read with 149 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life. He also found some of the appellants guilty of other offences like under Sections 147, 148, 323 and 324 IPC and awarded them lesser punishment for those offences.
2. Being aggrieved by the said order of conviction and sentence the accused persons filed an appeal before the High Court of Patna. During the pendency of the said appeal A-8, Lila Yadav died hence the appeal abated so far as he was concerned. The High Court confirmed the judgment of the trial court and consequently dismissed the appeal against which the appellants are before us in this appeal.
3.  The brief facts necessary for the disposal of this appeal are that on 20th July, 1981 at about 8 a.m. the appellants attacked the deceased Jaimangal Yadav father of PW.6 because of prior enmity consequent to which the said deceased suffered 7 injuries out of these 6 were simple in nature and one injury which was found in the temporal region proved to be a fatal. The prosecution alleges that these injuries were caused on the deceased by using weapons like lathi, Khanti and Bhala. Injured deceased was taken by PW.6 and others to Piligrim Hospital Gaya where he died at about 9 p.m. on 20th July, 1981.
4.  A complaint in this regard was made at police station Gaya at about 2 p.m. on 21st July, 1981. The trial court relied on the evidence of PW.7, Doctor who opined that the death of the deceased was caused by the injury to the temporal region hence found the appellants guilty of Section 302 read with 149 IPC and other Sections and sentenced them as stated above which sentence has been confirmed by the High Court.
5.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. We notice from the evidence of PW.6 the complainant, who also happened to be son of the deceased and an injured witness. We find no reason to reject his evidence and finding of the courts below that these appellants were responsible for the death of the Jaimangal Yadav as also the injuries caused to PW.6. The question for our consideration is that does this amount to an offence punishable under Section 302 read with 149 IPC or not.
From the nature of the injuries we are of the opinion that the appellants did not intend to cause the death of the deceased because the sharp edged weapons like khanti etc. though carried by the appellants were not used by the appellants in causing injuries to the deceased it is clear from the nature of the attack as spoken to by PW.6 that the intention of the appellants was at the most to cause grievous hurt which would fall under Section 326 read with 149 IPC i.e. so far as the injuries to the deceased is concerned.
6.  In the said view of the matter we modify the sentence imposed on the appellants under Section 302 read with 149 IPC to under Section 326 read with 149 IPC and award them five years' rigorous imprisonment on that count.
7.  We confirm the conviction imposed for the other offences under Sections 147, 148, 324 and 323 IPC but the sentences under these Sections will run concurrently with sentence imposed under Section 302 read with 149 IPC. With the said modification this appeal is allowed. If the appellants have served out any sentence same will be given set off. We are informed that one of the appellants is in custody, he will serve out his sentence. The others will surrender to serve out the sentence as imposed hereinabove and their bail bonds are cancelled.
Appeal allowed.
