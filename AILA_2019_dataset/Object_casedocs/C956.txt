Surendra Singh Bhandari v State of Uttranchal
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2419/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the State.
2.  The appellant on being convicted under Section 420, 467, 468 of the Indian Penal Code and 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act moved the High Court.
3. The High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the conviction and sentence passed by the Special Judge, Anti Corruption, U.P., (East) Dehradun. Against the said judgment of the High Court the present appeal has been preferred.
4.  The sole grievance of the appellant is that there is no discussion of the evidence on record by the appellate court and as such the appellate court has failed to discharge its obligation as court of appeal against the order of conviction and sentence.
5.  We find sufficient force  in the aforesaid contention. Having examined the impugned judgment of the High Court, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court has failed to exercise its jurisdiction as court of appeal. We therefore, set aside the impugned judgment and remand the criminal appeal to the High Court of Uttaranchal for re-disposal of the same in accordance with the law. The High Court may dispose it of at an early date. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
