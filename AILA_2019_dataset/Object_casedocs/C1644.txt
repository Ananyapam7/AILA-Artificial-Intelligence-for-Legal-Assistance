Kuppan and Others v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

24 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 82 of 2000, Dt. 24 January 2000.
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In this case three appellants have been convicted and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment of offences under Sections 326, 324 and 452 of the Indian Penal Code. In appeal the conviction and sentences were confirmed but in revision the sentence was reduced to imprisonment for a period of one and a half years for the first accused under Sec. 326 mainly. For the third accused the same period of imprisonment was awarded for the offence under Section 324, I.P.C. Second accused was sentenced only to pay a fine of Rs. 1,500/-.
2.  The grievous hurt was inflicted on the head of the injured and that is attributed to the first accused. We are not inclined to disturb the sentence imposed by the High Court on the first accused. Even regarding second accused (she is sentenced to fine alone) there is no reason to interfere with the sentence. But the sentence as for the third accused who is the son of A.1 and A.2 appears to be excessive as he is convicted only under Sec. 324, I.P.C. besides Sec. 341.
3. We, therefore, reduce the sentence imposed on the third accused for the offence under Sec. 324, I.P.C. to the period already undergone. In other words he shall be set at liberty. The fine portion of the sentence is also deleted as for A.3.
The Appeal is disposed of.
Appeal Disposed of.
