4. When the matter came up before this Court, we issued notice to the de-facto complainant as well. However, there is no appearance on his behalf.

6. We make it clear that the appellant shall cooperate with the trial and shall not influence witnesses in any way. In case of any non-cooperation on the part of the appellant, it shall be open to the State to apply for cancellation of bail.
