Rajdutt and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 114/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants were convicted under Section 325 read with Section 149 besides Sections 323, 324, 147 and 148 of the IPC. The major offence is under Section 325 of the IPC. It is a compoundable offence. Now the appellants have come to terms with the victim in the episode. An application has been filed seeking permission to compound the offence. An affidavit has been sworn to by Mr. Prem Lal and Mr. Jugan Pal, stating that the matter has been settled between the parties.
2. We, therefore, accord permission to compound the compoundable offences. As the conviction under Section 147 and 148 of the IPC has become redundant now we delete those counts.
3.  In the result we acquit the appellants under Section 320(8) of the Code of CriminalProcedure. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
